1. Add a slider that indicates how many of the total number of gates the player passes. Change the default image resource of the slider with sprites provided in "Assets/Textures/HUD.png". Keep the counter text. For reference see the "Assets/Example.mkv".
2. Change timer from slider to filled type image. Use the "Assets/Textures/Timer.png" asset. For reference see the "Assets/Example.mkv".
3. Rework the gates. 
	a. Disable the left and the right beams' renderers. Keep the colliders.
	b. Place Flame Stream from "Assets/ParticleSystems/FlameStream.prefab" on the beams's place. Fix the ParticleSystem component's properties as you like.
	c. Place the flames on the beams' places and "curve" the fire to produce a shape like an arc.
4. Duplicate the reworked gate at least 4 times in a random location through the editor.
5. The first gate flames will emit at play state. Stop the emitting to all other gates.
6. When the player (plane) crosses the current gate, stop its flames and ignite the next gate flames. For reference see the "Assets/Example.mkv".
Warning: Before send the homework delete "Assets/Example.mkv".
