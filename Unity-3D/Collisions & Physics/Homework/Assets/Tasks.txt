1. Rework the script ItemDropper.cs file to work with rigidbody. Don't forget to attach rigidbody and collider to the crate template. Remove redundant ItemFalling.cs component from the project and its usages. 
2. Add rigidbody to the plane. Change the movement and rotation to be with rigidbody's AddRelativeForce() and AddRelativeTorque() methods.
4. Create a gate to passes with the plane (see the image "Gate.png" sibling to that file).
3. Create a script called ColliderDetector.cs and implement the "OnTriggerEnter" method which will detect when to pass the gate then log in to the console "Gate passed!".
4. In ColliderDetector.cs implement the "OnCollisionEnter" method which will detect when the plane crash on the side of the gate then logs in the console "Plane crashed! Game Over".
5. (Hard) Raycast forward from the plane. When hitting any collider in the world print in the console "Did Hit {name of the object}". Do that on the "Update" method.
You can use that code for help with that task https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Physics.Raycast.html and https://youtu.be/USwrSUpIgLI
Important! You can see the result from "Debug.DrawRay" only in the Scene window. Cannot see it inside the Game window.
